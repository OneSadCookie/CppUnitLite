This version of CppUnitLite is based on the original by Michael Feathers.

See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CppUnitLite for information.

I've modified it to build without errors under strict GCC warning settings, and to print some handy progress dots to standard output while it runs the tests.

In the absence of any license on the original, I'm placing my modified version under the zlib/libpng license.  See license.txt for details.

Makefile (replacing build.rb) provided by Tang Xinfa.
